# Ocean - C/C++ Project Manager
Ocean is a project manager, similar to Rust's Cargo, for C and C++ written with Rust - *that other systems programming language*. The command syntax is very similar to that of Cargo's.

By default, Ocean will use `gcc` to compile C and C++ source files, outputting the executables to `build/{mode}/{project_name}`.
