# Ocean - C/C++ Project Manager
Ocean is a project manager, similar to Rust's Cargo, for C and C++ written with Rust - *that other systems programming language*. The command syntax is very similar to that of Cargo's.

By default, Ocean will use `gcc` to compile C and C++ source files, outputting the executables to `build/{mode}/{project_name}`.


## How to install

1) Make sure you have Cargo and Rust installed: https://rustup.rs/.
2) From a command line, enter the following command: `cargo install --git https://github.com/STBoyden/ocean ocean`.
3) Done!

Make sure to use `ocean --help` if you're not sure how to use this application.
